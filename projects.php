      <p class="globalTextProjects">Junkyard Golf Club is one of the fasted growing operators in the competitive leisure market.</p>
      <p class="globalTextProjects">The concept has grown temporary pop-up to a full time operation with 12,000 SQF units at Truman Brewery, Westgate Oxford and First Street in Manchester.</p>

      <p class="globalTextProjects">In summer 2017 we delivered an outdoor screen and event space at Mercers Walk, a mixed use development in Covent Garden.</p>
      <p class="globalTextProjects">The pop up activity screened Wimbledon 2017 and featured street food, a live art installation and sports participation.</p>
      <p class="globalTextProjects">The venue enjoyed increased footfall, dwell time and engagement with the space and has subsequently gone on to let vacant retail at the development.</p>
